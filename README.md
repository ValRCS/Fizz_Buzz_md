Template for Fizz Buzz assignment

* Generate with Javascript 100 div elements within main tag
* Divs should have unique id such "myid1" until "myid100"

* Divs should have 4 different CSS classes depending on the following:
1. id number(1 to 100) divides evenly with 3 and 5 (15,30, etc)
2. id number(1 to 100) divides evenly with 3 ONLY (3,6,9)
3. id number(1 to 100) divides evenly with 5 ONLY (5,10)
4. id number(1 to 100) does not divide with 3 nor 5 (for example 4,7 etc)

* InnerText should contain the following:
1. id number(1 to 100) divides evenly with 3 and 5 (15,30, etc) : "FizzBuzz"
2. id number(1 to 100) divides evenly with 3 ONLY (3,6,9) : "Fizz"
3. id number(1 to 100) divides evenly with 5 ONLY (5,10) : "Buzz"
4. id number(1 to 100) does not divide with 3 nor 5 (for example 4,7 etc) : 4,7 etc

CSS you can make as fancy or plain as you want, each div should be fixed height and width 
BUT should respond to resizing browser window (for example 1 column 100 rows on small mobile, 5x20 on tablet, and 10x10 on large HD screen).

BONUS:

Add 4 Controls (TextBoxes, Sliders, etc) to control:
* Starting Value(default = 1)
* Ending Value (default = 100)
* Fizz Value (default = 3)
* Buzz Value (default = 5)

* Add Control(button) to Clear All the generated Divs!
* Add Control(button) to Generate Divs (based on the 4 controls ABOVE)
