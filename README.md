# Fizz_Buzz_md
Template for Fizz Buzz assignment

* Generate with Javascript 100 div elements within main tag
* Divs should have unique id such "myid1" until "myid100"
* Divs should have 4 different classes depending on the following:
1. id number(1 to 100) divides evenly with 3 and 5 (15,30, etc)
2. id number(1 to 100) divides evenly with 3 ONLY (3,6,9)
3. id number(1 to 100) divides evenly with 5 ONLY (5,10)
4. id number(1 to 100) does not divide with 3 nor 5 (for example 4,7 etc)
* InnerText should contain the following:
1. id number(1 to 100) divides evenly with 3 and 5 (15,30, etc) : "FizzBuzz"
2. id number(1 to 100) divides evenly with 3 ONLY (3,6,9) : "Fizz"
3. id number(1 to 100) divides evenly with 5 ONLY (5,10) : "Buzz"
4. id number(1 to 100) does not divide with 3 nor 5 (for example 4,7 etc) : 4,7 etc


BONUS:
Afterward we will work on adding custom controls and listeners to generate arbitrary number of boxes and dividers(for example 5 and 7 instead of 3 and 5)
